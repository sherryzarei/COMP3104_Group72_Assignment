DevOps (Development and Operations) is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that aims to integrate and automate the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. It focuses on continuous delivery, where software updates are produced more frequently and reliably by improving collaboration between developers and operations teams. A DevOps course typically covers topics like version control (e.g., Git), automation, continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), infrastructure as code (IaC), and monitoring systems. The goal is to reduce the time between writing code and deploying it in production while ensuring higher quality and more frequent releases.
