DevOps plays a crucial role in modern software development by fostering a culture of collaboration between development and operations teams. Traditionally, these teams operated in silos, leading to communication gaps and inefficiencies. By integrating DevOps practices, organizations can break down these barriers, encouraging teamwork and shared responsibilities. This collaborative environment not only accelerates the development process but also ensures that software is more reliable and aligned with business objectives, ultimately driving greater customer satisfaction.
